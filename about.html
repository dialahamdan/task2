<h1> McDonald'S </h1>
  <h2>Our story starts with one man</h2>
    <p>Back in 1954, a man named Ray Kroc discovered a small burger restaurant in California, and wrote the first page of our history. From humble beginnings as a small restaurant, we're proud to have become one of the world's leading food service brands with more than 36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.

<h2>About Our Food</h2>
  <p>From adding more balanced options to our Happy Meal®, to serving up fresh beef Quarter Pounder® burgers that are cooked when you order, we’re always finding ways to show our commitment to our customers and our food.
